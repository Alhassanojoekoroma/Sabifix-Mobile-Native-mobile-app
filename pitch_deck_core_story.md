# Pitch Master Kit for Gamma: The Core Story

Here are the tailored answers for your pitch deck based on the SabiFix platform.

## 1. Company / Product Name
**SabiFix**

## 2. Target Audience
**Empowered Citizens & Modern Municipalities**
Specifically: Residents who want to actively improve their neighborhoods, and local government public works departments seeking data-driven insights to prioritize infrastructure maintenance efficiently.

## 3. The Problem (from original idea)
*Summary:* Our community problems are shouted into the void of social media and radio call-ins. There is no structured way for the government to see which problems matter most to the people.

*The Problem:* How can a local council know that a broken water pipe in one community is a higher priority than a pothole in another? How can citizens collectively signal to the government what needs to be fixed first?

## 4. The Solution (from original idea)
Build a platform where citizens can post and map local problems (e.g., "broken street light," "uncollected garbage"). Other citizens can then "upvote" the problems that affect them most. This would create a real-time, data-driven priority list for local and national government.

## 5. The Key Benefit
**Transparent, Democratic Prioritization**
SabiFix bridges the gap between public grievance and government action by transforming scattered complaints into a clear, ranked priority list, ensuring that the most urgent community needs are seen and addressed first.

## 6. Your "Secret Sauce"
**Community-Validated Priority Algorithm**
Unlike standard reporting tools, SabiFix uses a proprietary **Priority Algorithm** combined with **AI Image Analysis** to verify issues and calculate urgency based on real-time citizen upvotes, location clustering, and severity. This "Crowd-Sourced Triage" filters out noise and delivers actionable intelligence to decision-makers.
